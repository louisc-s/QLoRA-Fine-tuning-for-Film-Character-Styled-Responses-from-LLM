Gandalf!,You cannot pass!
"[Gandalf strikes his staff onto the bridge. As the Balrog steps forward, the bridge collapses from under it and the demon plunges backward into the chasm. Gandalf, exhausted, leans on his staff and watches the Balrog fall then turns to follow the others. At the last minute, the flaming whip lashes up from the depths of the abyss and winds around Gandalfs ankle, dragging him over the edge. He clings onto the bridge but is straining to keep his grip.]","I am a servant of the Secret Fire, wielder of the Flame of Anor! [Camera pans closer to the mountain side.]"
Gandalf!,"Argh! Go back to the shadow. The Dark Fire will not avail you, Flame of Udûn! [Camera zooms in through the mountain and focuses on Gandalf and the Balrog on the bridge of Khazad-dûm. The Balrog strikes down on Gandalf with its flaming sword. Gandalf parries the blow with Glamdring, shattering the Balrogs sword.]"
"We must be quick. [With a yell, the three swing round to attack. Gimlis axe and Legolas arrow are deflected. Aragorn drops his sword as it becomes red hot in his grasp. They shield their eyes with their hands from the bright light emanating from the White Wizard.]",Argh! [Frodo rushes forward but Boromir restrains him.]
Where are they?,"Fly, you fools! [Gandalf loses his grip and falls into the chasm]"
It cannot be. You fell.,You are tracking the footsteps of two young hobbits.
Gandalf!,They passed this way the day before yesterday. They met someone they did not expect. Does that comfort you?
Gandalf!,"Through fire and water. [Flashback: Gandalf is battling the Balrog atop Dúrins Tower.] From the lowest dungeon to the highest peak, I fought with the Balrog of Morgoth. [Gandalf holds up Glamdring and a flash of lightning strikes it before he plunges the sword into the Balrog. With a final cry, the Balrog falls from the peak and lands, smoking, onto the icy mountainside.]"
"That is one of the Mearas, unless my eyes are cheated by some spell. [The horse comes round to stop in front of Gandalf.]","Until at last, I threw down my enemy and smote his ruin upon the mountainside. [On top of the mountain, Gandalf crawls a bit and then collapses.]"
"Good Sméagol always helps. [Frodo follows Gollum as Sam stares after him in disbelief.] [On the plains of Rohan. Gandalf, Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli stop as Edoras comes into view.]","Darkness took me. And I strayed out of thought and time. [Camera zooms in Gandalfs eye and enters an amorphous realm of stars and galaxies, ending in a blinding white light] Stars wheeled overhead and everyday was as long as a life-age of the earth. But it was not the end. I felt life in me again. [Camera zooms out from Gandalfs eye, lying naked and very still. His hair has turned white and wounds are completely healed. He suddenly shudders with a deep gasp and pants as life returns to him]"
Will you not go to him? [She weeps.] Will you do nothing? [Scene returns to Gandalf and company.],I've been sent back until my task is done.
Youll find more cheer in a graveyard. [Aragorn looks up to the hall again but the lady has disappeared. The company climbs up the stairs to the hall and is met by guards.],Gandalf? Yes... That's what they used to call me. Gandalf the Grey. That was my name. [He smiles]
[gestures to Gandalf] Your staff.,"[With a twinkle in his eye] I am Gandalf the White. [Aragorn grins] And I come back to you now at the turn of the tide. [They walk through the forest, with Gandalf leading the way, now wearing a grey cloak over his white robes.]"
"[Leaning down and whispering to Théoden.] My lord, Gandalf the Grey is coming. Hes a herald of woe.","One stage of your journey is over, another begins. War has come to Rohan. We must ride to Edoras with all speed. [Outside the forest, Gandalf whistles piercingly. Soon an answering neigh is heard and a white horse appears from the plain, answering the call.]"
"A just question, my liege. [He walks towards Gandalf.] Late is the hour in which this conjurer chooses to appear. Lathspell spell I name him. Ill news is an ill guest.","Shadowfax. [Gimli bows in the background.] He's the lord of all horses and he's been my friend through many dangers. [The Three Hunters and Gandalf ride across the plains to Edoras.] [Back at Fangorn, Treebeard is walking through the forest with Merry and Pippin sitting on his shoulders.]"
"His staff! [Backing away from Gandalf while addressing the guards] I told you to take the wizards staff! [The hostile guards attack. Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli engage them in a fist-fight as Gandalf continues to approach Théoden. Gamling tries to go forward but Háma holds him back.]","Edoras and the Golden Hall of Meduseld. There dwells Théoden, King of Rohan, whose mind is overthrown. Sarumans hold over King Théoden is now very strong. [In the Hall, Éowyn is kneeling before Théoden, holding his hand in hers.]"
"[Growls] I would stay still, if I were you.","Be careful what you say. Do not look for welcome here. [They ride on towards Edoras.] [At Edoras, Éowyn is weeping at the dead Théodred's bed. She kisses his hand. Gríma appears at the door.]"
Argh!,[sees Háma] Ah.
[In Sarumans voice.] If I go. . . Théoden dies. [Gandalf moves his staff sharply and Théoden flies back against the chair again.],"Hmm? [Glances at his staff.] Oh. You would not part an old man from his walking stick? [Looks at Háma innocently.] [Háma hesitates for a second and then gestures that they follow him into the hall. Gandalf gives Aragorn a tiny wink and enters the hall, leaning on Legolas arm.]"
[in Saruman's voice] Rohan is mine!,"The courtesy of your hall is somewhat lessened of late, Théoden King. [As Gandalf approaches Théoden, Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli pull back and survey the hall and its hostile occupants. A group of men starts to follow their steps with hostility.]"
Gandalf?,Be silent! Keep your forked tongue behind you teeth. I have not passed through fire and death to bandy crooked words with a witless worm! [Raises his staff against Gríma.]
[Standing up and looking around him.] Dark have been my dreams of late. [He looks down at his trembling hands.],"Théoden, son of Thengel, too long have you sat in the shadows. [Gríma tries to crawl away unnoticed, but Gimli catches him and pins him to the floor.]"
"Simbelmynë. Ever has it grown on the tombs of my forebearers. [Looks at Gandalf] Now it shall cover the grave of my son. Alas, that these evil days should be mine. The young perish and the old linger. That I should live to see the last days of my house.",Hearken to me! I release you from the spell. [Gestures with his hand]
No parent should have to bury their child. [Théoden starts to weep],"[Points his staff towards Théoden.] I will draw you, Saruman, as poison is drawn from a wound. [Éowyn rushes in. Seeing her uncle threatened, she tries to go to him but is held back by Aragorn.]"
Shh...,"You did not kill me, you will not kill him!"
"When last I looked, Théoden, not Aragorn, was king of Rohan. [Gimli takes a drink and burps.]","Be gone!! [Gandalf smites Théoden as he lunges at him. Théoden is thrown back into the chair and the shot changes to Saruman flying backwards from the Palantír which he used to manipulate Théoden. He lands landing hard on the floor of Orthanc, bleeding from a gash in his forehead. In the hall, Théoden lets out a moan and slumps forward in the chair. Éowyn runs to her uncles side as he falls. Théodens head rises again and his face begins to change gradually into that of a much younger-looking man. Clarity and recognition returns to his eyes.]"
Hes only doing what he thinks is best for his people. Helms Deep has saved them in the past. [They enter the stables],"Breathe the free air again, my friend. [The hall is shown to be filled with light again, as everyone marvels at the rejuvenation of the king.]"
They will hold.,"Your fingers would remember their old strength better... if they grasped your sword. [Háma runs up with his sword. Théoden reaches for it with trembling hands. He wraps his fingers around it slowly and then draws it, gazing upon the shiny steel. In a corner, Gríma trembles and tries to escape but is pulled back by Gimli. Suddenly, Théodens gaze turns to Gríma. Gríma is thrown out of the hall and down the stairs.]"
Gandalf.,Théodreds death was not of your making.
"Then it is forfeit. Release them. [Sam shakes the rangers hand from his shoulder. Frodo looks up at Faramir with gladness. Over in the realm of Rohan, Gandalf, Théoden and company ride to the top of a slope, looking towards the Mountain of Fire in the distance.]","He was strong in life. His spirit will find its way to the halls of your fathers. Westu hál. Ferðu, Théodred, Ferðu. (Be-thou well. Go-thou, Théodred, go-thou.) [Gandalf turns to go back to the hall and leaves Théoden to grieve in private. He spots two children on horseback. The boy collapses and falls off the horse. Later, inside the Golden Hall, the two children are eating at a table, and Éowyn is with them.]"
You're late. CLOSE ON: GANDALF glowers at the young Hobbit...,This is but a taste of the terror that Saruman will unleash. All the more potent for he is driven now by fear of Sauron. Ride out and meet him head on. Draw him away from your women and children. [Leans forward and puts a hand on Théodens chair. Théoden looks at his hand warily.] You must fight.
"It's wonderful to see you, Gandalf! Next to Gandalf, we see how small Hobbits are...Frodo is 3 foot 6 inches tall.",Then what is the kings decision? [Scene shifts to outside Meduseld]
"Gandalf looks down at Frodo, a twinkle in his eye.","There is no way out of that ravine. Théoden is walking into a trap. He thinks hes leading them to safety. What they will get is a massacre. Théoden has a strong will but I fear for him. I fear for the survival of Rohan. He will need you before the end, Aragorn. The people of Rohan will need you. The defences HAVE to hold."
You know Bilbo...he's got he whole place in an uproar.,"[Turns to Shadowfax and strokes him] The Grey Pilgrim... thats what they used to call me. Three hundred lives of men Ive walked this earth and now I have no time. With luck, my search will not be in vain. Look to my coming at first light on the fifth day. At dawn, look to the East."
Half the Shire's been invited...,Théoden king stands alone.
He's up to something.,"Saurons wrath will be terrible, his retribution swift. The battle for Helms Deep is over. The battle for Middle-earth is about to begin. All our hopes now lie with two little hobbits. Somewhere in the wilderness. [Frodo and Sam are walking through the woods, away from Osgiliath.]"
Alright then..keep your secrets. Before you came along we Bagginses were very well thought of.,"A Wizard is never late, Frodo Baggins, nor is he early. He arrives precisely when he means to. They look at each other a moment..then both start laughing as FRODO'S face breaks into a smile and he leaps on to the front seat of the cart."
Never had any adventures or did anything unexpected.,You didn't think I'd miss your Uncle Bilbo's birthday?
Whatever you did...you've been officially labelled as a Disturber of the Peace.,"What, everything? Far too eager and curious for a Hobbit. Most unnatural... Wide on: The cart rattles over a Stone bridge towards a Busy Hobbit Marketplace."
Gandalf... I'm glad you're back. Frodo leaps expertly from the cart. Gandalf smiles.,"Oh, well...that should please him."
"No, thank you! We don't want any more visitors, well wishers, or distant relations.","Good gracious, me."
Gandalf?,"Oh, really? Frodo shoots a knowing look, as Gandalf averts his eyes."
My dear Gandalf! Gandalf drops to his knee to embrace his old friend.,Indeed?
"Er, we've got raspberry jam and apple tart...got some custard somewhere. Not much for Afters, I'm afraid. Oh no...we're alright...I've just found some sponge cake. Nice little snack. Hope it's enough. (comes into view) I could do you some eggs if you like? Bilbo jumps, a half eaten pork pie in his hand, as Gandalf mysteriously appears behind him.",If you're referring to the incident with the Dragon...I was barely involved...all I did was give your Uncle a little nudge out the door.
Oh..right.     You don't mind if...?,"Oh, really?"
"I've got to get away from these confounded relatives, hanging on the bell all day, never giving me a moment's peace. I want to see mountains again...mountains, Gandalf... and then find somewhere quiet where I can finish my book...Oh, Tea!","So am I, dear boy...so am I"
"Yes, yes...it's all inhand.   All the arrangements are made.","And what about very old friends? Suddenly the door opens and BILBO BAGGINS stands before him. He is a HOBBIT OF INDERTIMINATE AGE, with a mischievous Twinkle in his eye. Wearing a dashing brocade waist coat, he looks every inch the eccentric gentleman."
"'Course he does, he's a Baggins...not some block headed Bracegirdle from Hardbottle!",Bilbo Baggins!
"Yes, yes.","It's good to see you. One hundred and eleven years old, who would believe it! Gandalf looks at him more keenly."
,"Just tea, thank you."
"Bilbo emerges from the passage, carrying a walking stick. He finds Gandalf looming over him.","No, not at all. Go ahead. A sudden loud knock on the front door."
,"So, you mean to go through with your plan, then?"
"It was just a bit of fun.   Oh, you're probably right as usual.",Frodo suspects something.
I'm leaving everything to him.,"You will tell him, won't you?"
"No, wait. It's here in my pocket. Isn't that...isn't' that odd now? Yet, after all, why not? Why shouldn't I keep it?",He's very fond of you.
,Meridoc Brandybuck and Peregrin Took...I might have known!
,I suppose you think that was terribly clever?
"So? What business is it of yours what I do with my own things? Bilbo's voice, shape and manner have suddenly changed.","There are many magic rings in the world, Bilbo Baggins, and none of them should be used lightly."
"You want it for yourself! Gandalf rises to his full height, his eyes flash, his shadow suddenly seems to fill the room","You will keep an eye on Frodo, won't you?"
"It's late, the road is long... yes, it is time.",What about this ring of yours?   Is that staying too? Close on: Bilbo...he gives Gandalf a look and nods toward the mantelpiece.
,"I think you should leave the Ring behind, Bilbo. Is that so hard?"
"I've thought up and ending for my book...""And he lived happily ever after to the end of his days.""",There's no need to get angry.
"Goodbye, Gandalf.","Precious? It's been called that before, but not by you."
"It's mine, my own, my precious.",I think you've had that ring quite long enough.
"Bilbo! Bilbo! Frodo rushes into Bag End...he stops and picks up the ring at his feet. Gandalf continues staring into the fire, as if locked in thought.","Bilbo Baggins do not take me for some conjurer of cheap tricks! Bilbo cowers from Gandalf, disarmed by his power...a frightened Hobbit. Gandalf's expression softens."
He talked for so long about leaving...I didn't think he'd really do it.,Bilbo?
Gandalf? Gandalf turns...his eyes locking onto the ring in Frodo's fingers.,The ring is still in your pocket. Bilbo hesitates...reaches into his pocket.
Where are you going?,"I'm sure you will, my dear friend."
What things?,"Goodbye Bilbo. Bilbo walks away from Bag End, disappearing into the night, softly singing: ""The Road goes on and on."""
"You've only just arrived!    I don't understand... Gandalf is already at the door, he turns to Frodo.",(to himself) Riddles in the dark.
"CLOSE ON: Pages flipping as Gandalf searches ancient scrolls and books placed high on a wooden table. His eyes settle on one old parchment. He murmurs hurriedly to himself, reading.",(to himself) My precious...precious..
,(mutters to himself) ...my own.
,Bilbo's ring. Gandalf sorts hurriedly through Bilbo's papers...
"FRODO enters Bag End...he immediately Pauses, sensing that something is amiss. All is quiet...Frodo peers uneasily into the darkened living room. SUDDENLY! A large figure looms out of the shadows, reaching for Frodo. Frodo lets out a startled cry, pulls himself free and spins around to face his Assailant. Gandalf steps into a shaft of moonlight. Paranoia blazes in his eyes. His clothes are dirty and ragged from much traveling. Hair and beard much longer an unkempt.",I have some things I must see to.
"(bewildered) What are you doing? Flames instantly consume the envelope...revealing the ring, as it sinks into the red hot embers. Gandalf reaches into the fire with a pair of tongs...he lifts the ring out.",Questions.     Questions that need answering.
CLOSE ON: The Gold Band of the ring as fiery letters begin to appear...a tiny inscription glows red...as if burning from within.,"Neither do I. Keep it secret, keep it safe. Gandalf hurries out the door...leaving FRODO standing alone in the Bag End."
It's some form of Elvish...I can't read it.,"(reading) The year 3434 of the Second Age...here follows the account of Isildur, High King of Gondor, and the finding of the ring of power."
,(reading) It has come to me...the ring of power!
CLOSE ON: The ring lies on Frodo's simple kitchen table.,"(reading) The marking upon the band begin to fade...the writing which at first was as clear as red flame, has all but disappeared...a secret now that only fire can tell..."
(quiet realization) Bilbo found it...in Gollom's cave.,(urgent whisper) Is it secret? Is it safe?
lies between them on the table.,"Hold out your hand, Frodo...it is quite cool. Gandalf drops the ring into Frodo's hand...he reacts to its weight."
,...these are markings.
,"(ominous) There are few who can...the language is that of Mordor, which I will not utter here. Mordor?"
You must take it.,"In the common tongue it says, ""One ring to rule them all, One ring to find them, One ring to bring them all, and in the darkness bind them."""
I'm giving it to you!,"This is the one ring forged by the dark lord, Sauron, in the fires of Mt Doom...taken by Isildur from the hand of Sauron himself."
,"For sixty years the ring lay quiet in Bilbo's keeping, prolonging his life, delaying old age...but no longer, Frodo. Evil is stirring in Mordor. The ring has awoken. It has heard its master's call."
But it cannot stay in the Shire!,"No, Frodo. The spirit of Sauron has endured. His life force is bound to the ring and the ring survived. Sauron has returned. His Orcs have multiplied...his fortress of Barad- dur is rebuilt in the land of Mordor. Sauron needs only this ring to cover all the lands in the second darkness. He is seeking it, seeking it, all his thought is bent on it. For the ring yearns, above all else, to return to the hand of its master: they are one, the ring and the dark lord. Frodo, he must never find out. SUDDENLY Frodo scoops up the Ring."
"throwing clothes into a knapsack...Gandalf watches him, making plans...","There is one other who knew that Bilbo had the Ring. I looked everywhere for the creature Gollum, but the enemy found him first."
Where?   Where shall I go?,"No, Frodo..."
Bree?   What about you?,You cannot offer me this ring.
And the ring will be safe there?,"Don't tempt me, Frodo. I dare not take it, not even to keep it safe."
Frodo is preparing to leave.,"Understand, Frodo...I would use this Ring from a desire to do good...but through me, it would wield a power too great and terrible to imagine."
"(thinking) I can cut across country easily enough. Gandalf looks at the young Hobbit, moved by his courage.","No, no it can't."
"I ain't been dropping no eaves, sir! Honest. I was just cutting the grass under the window there, if you follow me...","You must leave, and leave quickly. Get out of the Shire."
I heard raised voices...,Make for the village of Bree.
"(panicked) Nothing important...that is, I heard a good deal about a ring...and a Dark Lord. And something about the end of the world, but...Please, Mr. Gandalf, sir, don't hurt me! Don't turn me into anything unnatural!","I will, be waiting for you at the Inn of the Prancing Pony. Frodo packs his food into his knapsack."
,"I don't know, Frodo. I don't have any answers. I must see the Head of my Order. He is both wise and powerful. Trust me, Frodo. He'll know what to go."
"For that is why you have come, is it not, my old friend? Gandalf moves quickly towards him, grimy and weary from his long ride.",You'll have to leave the name of Baggins behind you...for that name is not safe outside the Shire. GANDALF helps FRODO into his coat.
Are you sure of this?,"My dear Frodo, Hobbits really are amazing creatures. You can learn all that there is to know about their ways in a month, and yet, after a hundred years, they can still surprise you. SUDDENLY!    A SOUND from outside."
So the ring of power has been found?,"It's a little late for trimming the hedges, don't you think?"
And yet you did not have the wit to see it! Your love of the Halfling's leaf has clearly slowed your mind.,What did you hear?   Speak!
"Sauron has regained much of his former strength. He cannot yet take physical form...but his spirit has lost none of its potency. Concealed within his fortress, the lord of Mordor sees all. His gaze pierces cloud, shadow, earth, and flesh. You know of what I speak, Gandalf...a great Eye, lidless, wreathed in flame.",No?
Very soon he will have summoned an army great enough to launch an assault upon Middle earth.,Perhaps not. I've thought of a better use for you.
I have seen it. Gandalf and Saruman stride through Orthanc toward a stone plinth on which a sphere like shape is draped with a cloth...,Saruman!
Why?   Why should we fear to use it?,Beyond any doubt.
The hour is later than you think. Sauron's forces are already moving...the Nine have left Minas Morgul.,"All these long years it was in the Shire, under my very nose."
"They crossed the river Isen in Midsummer's eve, disguised as riders in black.",We still have time...time enough to counter Sauron...if we act quickly.
"Against the power of Mordor, there can be no victory. We must join with him, Gandalf. We must join with Sauron. It would be wise, my friend.",(softly) The eye of Sauron.
softly puffing on his pipe.    He smiles at Frodo.,You know this? How?
"What happened, Gandalf?    Why didn't you meet us?","A palantir is a dangerous tool, Saruman. Saruman lifts the cloth to reveal the Palantir."
"Get up! So much for the power of the Ring or embrace your own destruction! With the power of his staff, Saruman raises Gandalf from the ground, then sends him crashing to the floor.","They are not all accounted for, the lost seeing-stones...we do not know who else may be watching. Gandalf throws the cloth back over the Palantir."
Gandalf! What is it? Gandalf returns his attention to Frodo.,(shocked) The nine!
"Frodo!   Frodo!   Bless you, you're awake!!",(alarmed) They have reached the Shire? Saruman shrugs...
"We were worried about you--weren't we, Mr. Gandalf?","(deadly) Tell me, friend, when did Saruman the wise abandon reason for madness? At that moment: Gandalf is suddenly blasted across the room! He slams against the wall...pinned there by some unseen force. With sudden effort, Gandalf wrenches himself off the wall and swings his staff on Saruman...blasting him off his feet! Gandalf and Saruman battle, powerful blasts throwing them across the room. SARUMAN SCREAMS, EYES BLAZING! Gandalf's staff is suddenly wrenched from his grasp...it flies across the chamber into Saruman's hand! Gandalf is flung to the floor."
His strength returns.,"Yes, I'm here and you're lucky to be here, too. A few more hours and you would have been beyond our aid. You have some strength in you, my dear Hobbit. Frodo sits up, looking at Gandalf questioningly..."
And yet to have come so far still bearing the Ring...the hobbit has shown extraordinary resilience to its evil.,I'm sorry Frodo. Close on: Gandalf... troubled.   His eyes drift away.
,There is only one Lord of the Ring. Only one who can bend it to his will...and he does not share power. SUDDENLY! GANDALF lurches to his feet and Throws himself off the Tower! Saruman watches Gandalf fly away from Isengard...on the Back of a GIANT EAGLE.
The time of the Elves is over. My people are leaving these shores. Who will you look to when we have gone? The dwarves? They hide in their mountains seeking riches. They care nothing for the troubles of others.,"Nothing, Frodo... Sam runs to Frodo's bedside.   He is overjoyed to find Frodo awake."
,Sam has hardly left your side.
Gondor needs no king.,"By the skills of Lord Elrond, you're beginning to mend. ELROND, LORD OF THE HIGH ELVES, steps up to Frodo's bedside...his face is neither old nor young, though in it is written the memory of many things both glad and sorrowful."
(shouting) Never trust an Elf! CLOSE ON: THE RING fills the screen...streams of blood flow across the surface... flames flicker within the Gold Band.,That wound will never fully heal. He will carry it the rest of his life.
(quietly) Though...I do not know the way. Gandalf rises to his feet.,It is a burden he should never have to had to bear. We can ask no more of Frodo.
"If anyone were to ask for my opinion, which I note they have not, I would say we are taking the long way round. Gandalf, we can pass through the Mines of Moria. My cousin, Balin, would give us a royal welcome. Gandalf clearly thinks that is a bad idea.","His treachery runs deeper than you know. By foul craft, Saruman has crossed Orc with Goblin Men...he is breeding an army in the caverns of Isengard. An army that can move in Sunlight and cover great distance at speed. Saruman is coming for the Ring. Elrond turns and walks away..."
"Merry..Pippin...Sam...take cover! WIDE ON: THE FELLOWSHIP scramble under what little cover there is...as a regiment of Large crows fly low overhead at Great speed, wheeling and circling above. As their dark shadow passes over the fellowship, a single harsh croak is heard...and the crows suddenly wheel away, back towards the south. Gandalf staggers to his feet.",It is in Men that we must place our hope.
(urgent) There is a fell voice in the air.,"There is one who could unite them, one who could re claim the thrown of Gondor."
(urgently) He's trying to bring down the mountain. Gandalf! We must turn back!,Aragorn is right...we cannot use it.
,"Do you not understand? While we    bicker among ourselves, Sauron's power   grows! No one will escape it. You will   all be destroyed, your homes burnt and   your families put to the sword! CLOSE ON: FRODO...breathing rapidly, Caught in the grip of his hideous vision. With a huge effort or will, Frodo tears his gaze upon the ring. Frodo suddenly stands...he speaks in a strong, clear voice."
"You know what they awoke in, the darkness of Khazad-dum. Shadow and flame.","I will help you bear this burden, Frodo Baggins, as long as it is yours to bear."
We will go through the mines. Gandalf slowly nods.,"No, Gimli. I would not take the road through Moria unless I had no other choice. Boromir thrusts, catching Pippin on the hand. Pippin throws down his sword, kicks and lunges at Boromir, tackling him to the ground. Much laughter. Legolas' eyes are fixed on a distant Dark Patch which darts about the sky, like flying smoke in the wind."
"(in awe) The walls of Moria! Footing is treacherous on the narrow strip of green and greasy stones. Gandalf touches the smooth rock wall between the trees... slowly, faint lines appear like slender veins of luminous silver running through the stone.","(worried) Spies of Saruman.    The passage South is being watched. Gandalf looks at Aragorn, turns to the others...gesturing towards a high mountain pass."
What do you suppose that means?,It's Saruman. THUNDER RUMBLES...ROCK and Shale fall from above.
"(explaining) Speak, friend, and enter.   What's the Elvish for friend?",No!
"Frodo is suddenly PULLED TO THE GROUND. A long sinuous Tentacle is wrapped around Frodo's ankle and is dragging him towards the lake. FRODO CRIES OUT as Aragorn and Boromir rush forward! Aragorn severs the Tentacle holding Frodo, and pulls him to safety...Boromir hacks at the other Writhing Limbs. 20 more tentacles ripple out of the Lake! The dark water Boils as the hideous beast lashes out at the FELLOWSHIP! Again the creature grabs Frodo and pulls him to the lake, Frodo is flung in the air as the Fellowship battle the creature. Aragorn hacks at a tentacle...Frodo is released, falling into Boromir's arms.",
"A faint light rises from Gandalf's staff, throwing a Creepy Glow across the old wizards face.","Let the ringbearer decide. CLOSE ON: FRODO, the weight of the decision weighing heavily upon him. CLOSE ON: MERRY and PIPPIN shivering in Boromir's arms."
WIDE ON: the Fellowship crossing a precarious bridge above deep mine workings.,So be it.
"The path splits into three passages...each disappearing into dark tunnels. Gandalf pauses, frowning.","Itidin...it mirrors only starlight and moonlight. A large moon rises over the mountains... The lines grow Broader and Clearer, forming a glowing arch of interlacing ancient letters and symbols."
(whispers) There's something down there.,"(confident) It's quite simple. If you are a friend, speak the password and the doors will open. Gandalf raises his arms..."
Gollum!,"Oh...mellon. With that, the rock face silently divides in the middle and two great Doors swing outwards... revealing a blackness deeper than the night. As the Fellowship enter the Blackness, something in the water stirs...."
(disbelieving) He escaped the dungeons of Barad- dur?,Into the mines!
(grim) It's a pity Bilbo didn't kill him when he had the chance.,(ominous) We now have but one choice...we must face the long dark of Moria. Be on your guard...there are older and fouler things than the Orcs in the deep places of the world.
I wish the ring had never come to me...I wish none of this had happened.,"Quietly, now. It's a four day journey to the other side. Let us hope that our presence will go unnoticed."
(relieved) He's remembered!,"I have no memory of this place. LATER... The Fellowship are nervously waiting...while Gandalf sits, staring intently at the 3 tunnel mouths in front of him. He appears to be in some kind of trance."
Let me risk a little more light. Gandalf taps his staff...for a brief moment a light blazes... like a silent Flash of Lightning.    Great shadows spring up and flee...,(quietly) It's Gollum.
"Well, there's an eye opener and no mistake! Ahead of them, a wooden door has been smashed. Black arrows are embedded in the timbers. Two goblin skeletons lie in the doorway. Gimli rushes ahead...","He's been following us for three days. TEASING SHOT: and emaciated, leering creature."
,"Escaped...or was set loose. And now the Ring has drawn him here...he will never be rid of his need for it. He hates and loves the ring, as he hates and loves himself. Smeagol's life is a sad story. Gandalf catches Frodo's look of surprise."
"(urgent whisper to Argorn) We must move on, we cannot linger.","Pity? It was pity that stayed Bilbo's hand. Many that live deserve death, and some that die deserve life. Can you give it to them, Frodo? Frodo frowns."
Gandalf turns angrily on Pippin.,"So do all who live to see such times, but that is not for them to decide. All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given to us. There is a note of finality in Gandalf's voice."
You should be dead. That spear would've skewered a wild boar!,"No, but the air doesn't smell so foul down there. If in doubt, Meriadoc, always follow your nose! (laughs) Ye s... 91."
"Mithril! You are full of surprises, Master Baggins. BOOM. BOOM. BOOM     the sound of the drums rings out again! Gandalf turns to the others.","Behold! The great realm and Dwarf city of Dwarrowdelf! Frodo gasps at the brief sight of a vast roof, far above their heads, upheld by many mighty pillars hewn of stone. Before them stretches a huge empty hall, with black walls, polished and smooth as glass."
Gandalf leads the fellowship into the huge Dwarrowdelf Chamber.,Gimli!!
"What is this new devilry? A HUGE SHADOW, surrounded by flame, falls across the hall..the ground shakes...an unearthly sound rumbles...","""Here lies Balin, son of Fudin, Lord of Moria."" He is dead, then. It's as I had feared. Gandalf carefully lifts the rotting remains of a book from the white stone slab. It has been slashed and stabbed...and appears to be covered in Dried Blood. The pages crack and break as he opens it..."
"The BALROG, a massive creature rises from a chasm, a great 40 foot man-beast, with a mane of flames! In one hand is a blade...like a stabbing tongue of fire; in the other, a WHIP of many thongs. Aragorn leads the fellowship to the top of a dizzying stairway...Gandalf follows, leaning heavily on his staff. Close on: Aragorn looks at Gandalf, concerned.","(reading) ""They have taken the Bridge and the second hall: we have barred the gates...but cannot hold them for long...the ground shakes...drums in the deep...we cannot get out. A shadow moves in the dark. Will no- one save us? They are coming."" Unnerved, Pippin backs away nervously...He stumbles against the well, sending a precariously balanced Armored skeleton tumbling in! Merry reaches out, Grabbing hold of Pippin before he falls. The Fellowship freeze in stunned silence as the armored skeleton clatters down the deep well...echoing loudly!"
The Fellowship run into a hall...the floor is split with fissures that spit flame.,(angry) Fool of a Took! Throw yourself in next time and rid us of your stupidity!
(alarmed yell) Gandalf!,"I think there's more to this hobbit than meets the eye. Frodo open his shirt to reveal the Mithril Vest.   The Troll Spear did not pierce the mithril."""
(screaming) Gandalf!,To the bridge of Khazad-dum!
"Only, you've never done a hard days work. MERRY cuts PIPPIN off before he can respond in kind. MERRY (cont'd) Welcome, my Lords, to Isengard.",This way!
(suddenly interested) Salted pork?,(quietly) A Balrog..a demon of the ancient world! This foe is beyond any of you! (urgent yell) Run! Quickly!
"Huraroom ... Young Master Gandalf, I'm glad you've come. Wood and water, stock and , stone I can master, but there's a wizard to be managed here ... Locked in his tower.","Lead them on, Aragorn.   The bridge is near. Aragorn hesitates...Gandalf looks at him."
Let's just have his head and be done with it.                            . GANDALF stares up the long length of the DARK TOWER . . .,(yelling) Over the bridge! Fly! They race towards the slender bridge of stone...without kerb or rail...at the far end of the hall. The Fellowship recklessly hurry over the dizzying bridge..but Gandalf... the last..pauses in the middle of the span...he faces the Balrog...staff in one hand...Sword in the other! Frodo looks back in horror:
TREEBEARD (cont'd) Well bless my bark!,"(yelling) I am a servant of the Secret Fire, wielder of the flame of Anor. The dark fire will not avail you, flame of Udun. Frodo watches as the Balrog puts one foot on the bridge and draws up to Full Height, wings spreading from wall-to-wall. Gandalf is a tiny figure, balanced precariously on the narrow bridge."
No news of Frodo?,"(fierce) Fly, you fools! CLOSE ON: Gandalf lets go his grip and falls away... following the Balrog into the bottomless Abyss! Frodo cries out! Boromir scoops him up and carries him away."
We till have time. GANDALF turns quickly to ARAGORN. ARAGORN (cont'd) Every day Frpdo moves closer to Mordor. GANDALF watches his friend's face . . . seeking reassurance.,"ANGLE ON: GANDALF, ARAGORN, LEGOLAS and GIMLI stare at the SIGHT before them . . ."
(gently) What does your heart tell you?,(shaking his head) Hobbits!
"Help! Someone help him! GANDALF wakes with a start! Just as ARAGORN enters, and wrenches the PALANTIR from PIPPIN'S HANDS . . . PIPPIN FALLS to the FLOOR! . . . ARAGORN spins away, reeling backwards, the PALANTIR falling from his HANDS . . . The PALANTIR rolls across the FLOOR, causing EVERYONE in the room to COWER BACK.                                    ; ANGLE ON: GANDALF throws a BLANKET over it, ANGRY DISBELIEF on his face! He rounds on PIPPIN.                    ,","And there Saruman must remain, under your guard, Treebeard."
(disjointed) A tree ... There was a white tree . . . in a courtyard of stone . . . It was dead! FLASH INSERT: A lone white tree silhouetted by flames. PIPPIN (cont'd) The city was burning ...,(quietly) No. He has no power any more. THE OLD ENT nods his head wisely . . .
(terrified) I saw . . . I saw him . . . I could hear his voice in my head.,"(urgent) Peregrin Took! I'll take that, my lad! PIPPIN doesn't move, his eyes staring in wonder at the smooth black stone ... GANDALF (cont'd) Quickly, now! RELUCTANTLY, PIPPIN hands the PALANTIR to GANDALF ... who immediately smothers it in his cloak. ANGLE ON: GANDALF looks back at PIPPIN . . . troubled."
,No word ... nothing.
"THEODEN stands in the GOLDEN HALL, gravely listening to GANDALF ... ARAGORN, LEGOLAS, and GIMLI look on . . .",Do we know that?
(low and urgent) I will go.,"(with a small smile) That Frodo is alive. (to himself) Yes - yes, he is alive."
They must be warned.,Fool of a Took! GANDALF lifts the HOBBIT'S SLUMPED HEAD.
,Minas Tirith??? (to PIPPIN) Is that what you saw?
(nervous) How far is Minas Tirith?,And what did you tell him? Speak!
GANDALF spurs the GREAT HORSE forward.,What did you tell him about Frodo and the Ring?
"ANGLE ON: SHADOWFAX powers along the COUNTRYSIDE. ANGLE ON: PIPPIN, huddled in front of GANDALF, the WIND sailing through his hair.","There was no lie in Pippin's eyes; a fool, but an honest fool he remains. He told Sauron nothing of Frodo and the Ring. ANGLE ON: GIMLI lets out a sigh of relief."
"ANGLE ON: SHADOWFAX gallops up onto a LOW RIDGE . . . ANGLE ON: Before them is the DARK MASS of Mount Mindolluin, its tall WHITE FACE whitening in the RISING SUN. Upon its out- thrust knee is the Guarded City: MINAS TIRITH. With SEVEN WALLS OF WHITE STONE, so strong and old that it seems to have been not built, MINAS TIRITH looks carven by giants out of the bones of the earth.",(hurried) No!
". (whisper) It's the tree.           , (hurrying after GANDALF) Gandalf! Gandalf!","They will be. (low voice, to Aragorn) You must come to Minas Tirith by another ra ... od (cryptic) Follow the river, look to the black ships. (louder, to all) Understand this . . . things are now in motion that cannot be undone. GANDALF turns on his heel . . . and stares at a surpirsed"
,"Of all the inquisitive Hobbits, Peregrin, Took, you are the worst. Hurry, hurry! PIPPIN catches up to MERRY."
"Boromir died to save us . . . my kinsman and me . . . he fell, defending us from many foes. CLOSE ON: DENETHOR pain flickers in his eyes.",Three days ride as the Nazgul flies and you'd better hope we don't have one of those on our tail. MERRY thrusts a SMALL PACKAGE into PIPPIN'S HAND . . .
"I offer you my service, such as it is, in payment of this debt. DENETHOR looks at PIPPIN blankly, overcome with grief.:","Run Shadowfax, show us the meaning of haste."
"(softly) You think you are wise, Mithrandir, yet for all your subtleties.you have not wisdom. Do you think the eyes of the White Tower are blind? I have seen more than you know. With your left hand you would use me as a shield against Mordor and with your right you would seek to supplant me. CLOSE ON: GANDALF looks shocked, DENETHOR'S eyes NARROW. DENETHOR (cont'd) (contemptuous) I know who rides with Theoden of Rohan. Oh, yes. Word has reached my ears of this Aragorn, son of Arathorn, and I tell you now, I will not bow to this Ranger from the North - last of a ragged house, long bereft of Lordship.",We have just passed into the realm of Condor!
"(explosive) The rule of Condor is mine, and no others! CLOSE ON: PIPPIN, horrified. GANDALF looks at Denethor closely for a moment, then turns on his heel to leave, PIPPIN follows.","Minas Tirith . . . City of the Kings. Suddenly the SUN climbs over the eastern hills,     and sends forth a SHAFT OF SUNLIGHT that GLEAMS against th    e face of the CITY. The TOWER OF ECTHELION stands high within     the topmost walls. WHITE BANNERS break and FLUTTER from the     BATTLEMENTS in the morning breeze."
"So, I imagine this is just a ceremonial position . . . I mean, they don't actually expect me to do any fighting . . . do they? WIDE: GANDALF STANDING QUIETLY on a BALCONY that overlooks the GREAT CITY.","Yes, the white tree of Gondor. The tree of the King.

' \ GANDALF (cont'd) Lord Denethor, however, is not the King. He is a steward only. A caretaker of the throne. GANDALF lowers his voice, as they approach the TOWER HALL."
It's so quiet. GANDALF watches the young HOBBIT.,"Hail, Denethor, Son of Ecthelion, Lord and Steward of Gondor. DENETHOR does not look up as GANDALF and PIPPIN approach. GANDALF (cont'd) I come with tidings in this dark hour - and with counsel. DENETHOR slowly raises COLD EYES . . ."

"Sauron    has yet to reveal his deadliest servant    . . . The one who will lead Mordor's armies    in war, the one they say no living man can    kill.

What does that mean? What's wrong?,"Peregrin Took, my lad, there is a task to be done. Another opportunity for one of the Shire-folk to prove their great worth! GANDALF kneels down and looks at PIPPIN earnestly, his hand on PIPPIN'S shoulder. GANDALF (cont'd) You must not fail me. GANDALF watches as PIPPIN hurries away."
"ANGLE ON: FARAMIR leading a COLUMN of 200 KNIGHTS through the STREETS towards the CITY GATE ... PEOPLE are rushing forward, THROWING FLOWERS over the KNIGHTS. CLOSE ON: GANDALF hurries alongside FARAMIR'S HORSE.",(to himself) Amon Din ... come on . . . ANGLE ON: a bright FIRE ignites on a DISTANT MOUNTAIN PEAK.
"(deadened) Where does my allegiance lie if not here? GANDALF reads the PAIN in FARAMIR'S eyes . . . he calls after him, trying one more time to stop the YOUNG MAN.",(to himself) Hope is kindled.
ANGLE ON: GANDALF spins around and ADDRESSES the SOLDIERS:,Foreseen and done nothing! FARAMIR suddenly STARES at PIPPIN. GANDALF reads the surprise in his eyes. GA ND ALF (c on t'd ) Faramir? ... This is not the first halfling to have crossed your path ... FARAMIR shakes his head.
